# AGENTS.md

Instructions for working on Terraform in this repository.

## Scope
- Applies to any Terraform (`.tf`, `.tfvars`, `.hcl`) changes in this repo.

## Workflow
- Prefer small, focused changes; avoid unrelated refactors.
- Keep Terraform and module versions stable unless explicitly asked to upgrade.
- Use variables/locals instead of hard-coding environment-specific values.
- Keep provider configuration centralized; avoid duplicating provider blocks across modules.

## Formatting & Validation
- Run `terraform fmt -recursive` on touched Terraform files.
- Run `terraform validate` when possible (requires initialized working dir).
- If validation can't run (missing credentials/backends), note it in the response.
- Prefer the Makefile helpers when working locally:
  - `make terraform-fmt`
  - `make terraform-validate`
  - `make terraform-plan`
  - `make terraform-init-backend` (when using a remote backend)
  - `make terraform-deploy`
  - `make terraform-destroy`

## Files & Structure
- Keep module boundaries clean; do not create cross-module dependencies.
- Keep outputs minimal and documented; avoid leaking secrets via outputs.
- Prefer `locals` for derived values and `data` sources over hard-coded IDs.

## Safety & Secrets
- Never commit credentials, tokens, or private keys.
- Use environment variables or secret managers for sensitive values.
- If a change could affect state/backends, call it out explicitly.

## Tests / Checks
- If the repo has CI or linting for Terraform, follow it.
- If adding new resources, include appropriate tags/labels per existing patterns.

## Worktrees

Every new task must start by creating a git worktree, unless the user specifies otherwise, in which case, this section about Worktrees and PRs do not apply.

All your changes must be implemented in the git worktree.

Worktrees are created with the following naming scheme:

- `.worktrees/issue-ISSUE_ID-SHORT_DESCRIPTION` (make sure to use the `.worktrees/` subdirectory, with a dot, not `worktrees/` without dot)
- `ISSUE_ID` comes from the GitHub issue number (e.g. `https://github.com/Recon-Fuzz/scfuzzbench/issues/73` -> `73`)
- `SHORT_DESCRIPTION` is a max 3-word kebab-case summary of the issue (e.g. `fix-lcov`)

If no GitHub issue is provided, use:

- `./worktrees/issue-NA-SHORT_DESCRIPTION` (e.g. `./worktrees/issue-NA-fix-lcov`)

When you are done, open a PR from the worktree branch. Then, new requests by the user should always be implemented on the worktree branch, and the corresponding PR updated.

## Analysis workflow
- Use the Makefile to generate all analysis outputs in one pass:
  - `make results-analyze-all BUCKET=... RUN_ID=... BENCHMARK_UUID=...`
- Optional overrides:
  - `EXCLUDE_FUZZERS=...` (comma-separated), `DURATION_HOURS=...`
  - `REPORT_BUDGET=...`, `REPORT_GRID_STEP_MIN=...`, `REPORT_CHECKPOINTS=...`, `REPORT_KS=...`
