# Skills

Machine-oriented workflows live in this directory.

- `target-onboarding/SKILL.md`: end-to-end process for creating and onboarding a new benchmark target.

You can import these files into agent systems that support skill-style instructions (for example, Codex) or use them as the source prompt/instructions for other agents (for example, Claude).
